## Description

This is a classic Pong game implemented in C++ using the Raylib library. The game features two paddles and a ball, with the objective being to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle. 

You can play against AI or second player.

I did it without any tutorials or hints, so the implementation of the game could very well be wrong :)
